### Analysis of the Instagram Follower Export Extension Code

## 1. Overview of `index.global.js`
- This script is likely responsible for **extracting followers from Instagram’s UI**.
- It interacts with the page's DOM and listens for changes (e.g., when more followers load).
- It includes a **browser extension API check**, meaning it will only run inside an extension.
- There's an **error check** to ensure it's only running in an appropriate context.

### Key Observations
- The script references `chrome.runtime`, confirming that it **communicates with the background script**.
- It might use **event listeners** to detect when the user opens the followers list.
- It could be using JavaScript's `querySelector` or `MutationObserver` to monitor changes to the followers' modal.
- Possible **scrolling function** to load more followers dynamically.

## 2. Overview of `index.mjs`
- This is the **background script** responsible for handling **extension-wide logic**.
- It **includes a polyfill** (`webextension-polyfill`), meaning it is designed to work across Chrome, Firefox, and possibly other browsers.
- The script likely facilitates:
  - Communication between content scripts and popup.
  - Data storage (e.g., saving exported followers).
  - External API calls (if any).
  
### Key Observations
- **CommonJS and ES module handling**: The script imports/export functions in a modular way.
- **Possible External Authentication**:
  - I will search for references to external URLs (`listmore.info` or other API endpoints).
  - If present, these will need to be removed or replaced for our independent version.

## Next Steps
### 1. Extract Functional Code
- I will search for:
  - **Follower extraction logic** in `index.global.js`.
  - **API calls or authentication** in `index.mjs`.

### 2. Identify What to Modify
- Remove **third-party authentication** (if found).
- Retain **follower extraction functions**.
- Ensure **direct access to Instagram’s DOM** for scraping.
