It appears that no explicit export logic or "Start Export" event listener was found in the files we reviewed, including index.global.js and popup.js.
What This Means:

    Export Logic: The actual logic for exporting followers (e.g., CSV, JSON, or direct download) might be hidden behind other functions or integrated elsewhere in the extension.
    Event Listener: The "Start Export" button might not be directly wired into the logic we've analyzed. It could be handled dynamically or via another function that we havenâ€™t yet identified.

Next Steps:

    Search for Export Logic in Other Files:
        The export logic might be in other modules, such as those in the dist/exportPanel/ directory or hidden behind a more complex interaction.
    Look for Button Trigger in Other Files:
        If the button's action is not directly found in popup.js, we might need to search the UI framework (e.g., Vue.js or other) for how events are managed or triggered.
