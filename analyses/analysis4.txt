### Analysis of `index.mjs` and `index.global.js`
This analysis focuses on **API calls, data storage, and authentication handling**.

---

## 1. Key Issues in `index.mjs` (Background Script)
### ‚úÖ API Calls Found:
- **External URLs:**
  ```plaintext
  https://insfo.listmore.info
  https://github.com/uuidjs/uuid
  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QotwABRip24
  ```
  - **Issue**: `insfo.listmore.info` is still referenced, meaning the extension likely **sends data externally**.
  - **Solution**: Remove all dependencies on `listmore.info` to make the extension fully independent.

### ‚úÖ Authentication Triggers:
- **Keywords found:** `"token"`, `"listmore.info"`
  - **Issue**: The extension **checks for authentication tokens**, possibly enforcing login before allowing exports.
  - **Solution**: We need to **bypass this check** so that authentication is only required for Instagram access (not external services).

### ‚ùå No Evidence of Storage Handling
- There were **no matches for `chrome.storage` or `localStorage`**.
  - **Implication**: This script may **not** be responsible for storing extracted data.
  - **Next Steps**: We should check **other files** for where extracted followers are stored.

## 2. Key Issues in `index.global.js` (Export & UI Logic)
### ‚úÖ API Calls Found:
- **Instagram API Calls:**
  ```plaintext
  https://www.instagram.com/graphql/query
  https://www.instagram.com/api/v1
  https://www.instagram.com/api/v1/web
  ```
  - **Issue**: The extension may rely on **Instagram's private API**.
  - **Solution**: Ensure the code **does not violate Instagram's terms of service**.

- **External Services (to be removed):**
  ```plaintext
  https://insfo.listmore.info
  https://mixpanel.com (analytics tracking)
  ```
  - **Issue**: `listmore.info` is referenced, likely sending exported data externally.
  - **Solution**: Remove all references to external services.

### ‚úÖ Authentication Checks Found:
- **Keywords:** `"token"`, `"login"`, `"auth"`
  - **Issue**: The script **checks if the user is logged in** before allowing exports.
  - **Solution**: Modify the script to **only require Instagram authentication**, not third-party authentication.

### ‚úÖ Storage Handling Found:
- **Local Storage Detected:**
  ```plaintext
  localStorage.s
  localStorage.e
  localStorage.r
  localStorage.i
  localStorage.g
  ```
  - **Implication**: The script **stores data locally in the browser**.
  - **Next Steps**: We should confirm:
    - **What data is stored?** (Follower lists? API responses?)
    - **Can we replace it with `chrome.storage` for persistence?**

---

## Final Recommendations
### **1. Remove External Dependencies**
- **Eliminate `listmore.info` references** in both scripts.
- **Disable Mixpanel (`mixpanel.com`) analytics tracking.**

### **2. Bypass Third-Party Authentication**
- Modify `index.mjs` and `index.global.js` so that the extension **only requires Instagram authentication**.

### **3. Verify Instagram API Usage**
- Ensure the extension **does not violate Instagram's terms** by using unauthorized API requests.

### **4. Improve Data Storage**
- **Replace `localStorage` with `chrome.storage`** if data persistence is needed.

### Next Steps
Would you like to:
1. **Proceed with removing external dependencies (`listmore.info`, `mixpanel.com`)?**
2. **Further analyze how follower data is stored before modifying storage behavior?** üöÄ
